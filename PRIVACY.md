# Gapwise Privacy Notice

_Last updated: 2026-09-27_

Gapwise is an independent student project for students across supported Canadian universities. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or an official service of any university.

This notice describes the implementation-backed data handling of the public Gapwise application at `gapwise.ca` and the optional Gapwise AI integration service. It is not a legal opinion about which privacy law applies to every user or circumstance.

## What stays in your browser

- The original imported timetable file is parsed locally and is not uploaded, including ACORN `.ics` exports for U of T.
- Gap calculations and campus route calculations run in the browser.
- Guest timetables remain local to the browser.
- Signed-in users may keep non-extractable cryptographic keys and encrypted private records in IndexedDB when the browser supports durable `CryptoKey` storage.

## Optional signed-in cloud features

If you sign in with Microsoft, Google, or GitHub OAuth, Supabase and the selected identity provider process the authentication account and browser session required for that feature.

If you explicitly enable private cloud sync, Gapwise encrypts the private timetable/settings payload in the browser before it is written to Supabase. Supabase stores ciphertext, cryptographic metadata, and the minimum account/relationship metadata required to provide the feature.

The original imported timetable file is never stored in the cloud. Gapwise does not store a history of calculated routes or gap recommendations as part of ordinary private cloud sync.

## Optional AI integrations

Gapwise AI is opt-in. Connecting an AI client does not automatically expose timetable data. A signed-in user must explicitly enable an AI delegation and choose which supported categories may be shared, such as the academic timetable, personal timetable items, deterministic Gapwise gap plans, gap-planning preferences, or routing preferences. Write permissions for personal timetable items and gap preferences are separate and default off.

The delegated AI snapshot is a minimized copy built from Gapwise's canonical parsed data. It does not contain the original ACORN `.ics` file, friend data, precise live location, Gapwise's primary private-data encryption keys, identity-provider access tokens, OAuth authorization codes, or OAuth refresh tokens. Academic class meetings are read-only through the AI integration.

When deterministic gap-plan sharing is enabled, Gapwise may include its own precomputed routing/gap assessment for a delegated gap, such as route status and confidence, travel and buffer time, leave-by/arrival time, ranked recommendations, reasons, tags, and timeline segments. The AI service is instructed to treat these source-backed Gapwise results as authoritative instead of inventing missing route or timetable facts.

AI delegation data and queued AI actions are encrypted separately before storage in Supabase with a dedicated Gapwise AI encryption key held by the Gapwise AI Vercel service. The Gapwise AI service can decrypt that delegated copy transiently to answer an authorized tool call. It does not receive Gapwise's primary private-cloud data-encryption key.

When an authorized AI client calls a Gapwise tool, the specific tool output needed for that request is sent to that AI provider. The provider may process conversation and tool data under the provider's own terms, privacy policy, account settings, and retention practices. Gapwise does not control an external AI provider's handling of data after the user authorizes and invokes that provider.

AI write tools do not directly rewrite the canonical encrypted timetable. They create encrypted, revision-bound pending actions. The Gapwise browser validates and applies supported actions to canonical private state. Imported academic meetings cannot be targeted by those write tools.

Supabase OAuth access tokens identify the exact OAuth client, and Gapwise uses that client identity together with row-level security and a per-user approval record to isolate third-party AI access from the primary encrypted timetable/key store and unrelated signed-in features. Revoking Gapwise AI removes the delegated snapshot and queued AI actions and removes the corresponding Gapwise AI client approval; Gapwise also requests revocation of the associated OAuth grant.

## Encryption trust model

Gapwise uses browser-side AES-256-GCM application-layer encryption. Per-user data-encryption keys are wrapped under a versioned key-encryption key held by the Vercel server environment. A signed-in device can ask the Vercel key broker to unwrap and re-wrap those data keys to a device public key.

This means Supabase does not receive readable timetable payloads, but Vercel is inside the cryptographic trust boundary. The optional Gapwise AI service is also inside the trust boundary for the separate, explicitly delegated AI copy when that feature is enabled. Gapwise therefore does **not** claim end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge encryption, or that only the user can ever decrypt cloud data.

## Friend availability and community state

Friend overlap uses a separate encrypted, deliberately lossy availability capsule. It excludes course names, room numbers, buildings, activity labels, and the full timetable. A successful common-gap request requires a mutually accepted friendship and returns at most three rounded common free windows for the selected term.

Optional community features may also store account-linked crowd reports, rate-limit metadata, publisher state, and audit metadata needed to operate and protect those features. Crowd reports are treated as time-bounded signals; exact provider backup and log retention is not established by the repository.

## Operational analytics, diagnostics, maps, and cookies

The current Gapwise web app does not initialize Vercel Web Analytics, Speed Insights, or custom product events. It does not send timetable contents, AI-delegated snapshot plaintext, AI action plaintext, friend data, precise live location, or authentication tokens as analytics events.

Ordinary Vercel hosting/runtime logs can still contain technical request metadata. The connected production account is currently on Vercel's Hobby plan; the project does not claim that Vercel's Pro/Enterprise Data Processing Addendum applies to that Hobby account.

Gapwise uses OpenFreeMap for map style/tile delivery. Opening a map can create a direct browser request to `tiles.openfreemap.org`; Gapwise does not attach the user's private timetable payload to that map request. OpenFreeMap's published privacy policy says ordinary logs are anonymized and omit IP addresses by default, while temporary IP logging may be enabled during security incidents for up to 30 days and Cloudflare may participate in delivery.

The current Gapwise application does not add advertising or cross-site tracking cookies, and it does not contain advertising. If telemetry changes to use non-essential cookies, identifiable profiling, advertising, or other tracking that requires consent in an applicable jurisdiction, Gapwise must reassess notice and consent before that change ships.

Server diagnostics can include operational request/error information. Credential-shaped data is redacted from expanded catastrophic-error diagnostics before it reaches application logging. Hosting and other providers can independently retain ordinary infrastructure logs under their own settings and policies.

Vercel, Supabase, Microsoft, Google, GitHub, OpenFreeMap-related infrastructure, and any AI provider a user chooses to connect may process technical or account information when their respective hosting, authentication, mapping, operational, or AI services are used.

Gapwise does not sell personal data.

## Retention and deletion

Cloud data remains until it is replaced, explicitly deleted, or the account is deleted, subject to infrastructure logs/backups maintained by the hosting providers under their own retention practices.

An enabled AI delegation remains until it is replaced, revoked, or the account is deleted. Queued AI actions are retained as part of the AI bridge until they are completed/rejected or AI access/account data is removed; revoking the delegation removes all queued and completed AI action rows held by the Gapwise AI bridge for that user.

A signed-in user can choose **Delete account and cloud data** from the account menu. The application permanently deletes the Supabase authentication account and user-owned application records through database cascades, then clears that user's Gapwise private state from the current browser. Account deletion is permanent.

Clearing browser/site data removes locally stored Gapwise data from that browser but does not by itself delete an existing cloud account or revoke an external AI provider connection.

Provider logs and backups may have separate retention and deletion behavior that the application cannot truthfully infer from source code. The current Supabase organization is on the Free plan in `ca-central-1`; Supabase recommends Free projects maintain their own off-site logical backups rather than relying on paid-plan downloadable backup access. Exact provider log retention and contractual deletion commitments remain provider/account evidence rather than source-code facts.

## Access, correction, portability, objections, and privacy requests

Privacy rights depend on the law and facts that apply to the service and user; presence in a particular country does not by itself establish territorial scope. Where applicable, a person may be entitled to ask what personal information Gapwise holds about them, request access or correction, request deletion or portability, object to certain processing, or withdraw consent for optional processing.

Gapwise provides self-service controls for local data, optional cloud/AI features, AI delegation revocation, and account/cloud-data deletion. No general-purpose self-service account-data export is currently represented as a shipped feature.

For a privacy request that cannot be completed with product controls, contact the repository owner through <https://github.com/andrewmuratov> and ask for a private privacy-request channel. **Do not put personal information, identity evidence, account data, or legal documents in a public GitHub issue.** A dedicated monitored privacy contact, accountable privacy role, identity-verification procedure, and response workflow remain administrative items requiring owner confirmation and, where appropriate, qualified legal review.

## Security and privacy incidents

The primary private-cloud security design and trust boundaries are documented in [`docs/PRIVATE_CLOUD_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/PRIVATE_CLOUD_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md). Gapwise also maintains [`docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`](docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md), which requires privacy triage when personal information may have been accessed, lost, changed, disclosed, or made unavailable without authorization.

The runbook deliberately does not promise a universal breach-notification deadline. Reporting, notification, recordkeeping, and preservation duties depend on the applicable law, contracts, risk assessment, affected data, and incident facts. Applicable duties must be confirmed for the actual incident rather than copied from a generic checklist.

Security reports should follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Accountability and provider verification

The implementation/data inventory is maintained in [`docs/TRUST_DATA_INVENTORY.md`](docs/TRUST_DATA_INVENTORY.md). The dated production-provider verification for this notice is recorded in [`docs/PROVIDER_PRIVACY_AUDIT_2026-08-30.md`](docs/PROVIDER_PRIVACY_AUDIT_2026-08-30.md). Together they intentionally separate repository/live-provider evidence from operator and legal facts that still require human confirmation.

Current verified production facts include the Supabase Free-plan project in Canada Central, the Vercel Hobby hosting plan, the absence of Supabase Storage buckets, the protected account-deletion Edge Function, reviewed database privilege boundaries, the identity-only OAuth implementation, and the OpenFreeMap runtime map-delivery boundary. Those point-in-time facts can change independently of the repository and must be rechecked after provider/account changes.

Before making stronger public claims, the owner still needs to verify or assign, as applicable:

- the accountable privacy role and monitored privacy-request channel;
- the operator's legal/business structure and the privacy laws that apply to its actual activities;
- Vercel team Data Preferences, provider/team access ownership, and any dashboard-only privacy/security settings not exposed by the connected APIs;
- any required processor agreement or international-transfer mechanism, including the fact that current Vercel DPA terms state processor coverage for Pro/Enterprise rather than the connected Hobby plan;
- the separate encrypted off-site database backup and restore drill appropriate to the current Supabase Free-plan posture;
- any jurisdiction-specific request response, breach record, regulator, representative, or transfer obligations; and
- changed analytics, marketing, payment, or profiling behavior before those features are introduced.

## Changes

This notice may be updated when Gapwise changes its data handling or service providers. Material data-handling changes should be reflected here before the changed behavior is promoted to users.
