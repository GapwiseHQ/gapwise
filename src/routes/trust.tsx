        <p>
          Gapwise is an independent student project with university editions worldwide. It is not an
          official university service and does not claim university review, sponsorship,
          endorsement, certification, or procurement approval. This page separates
          implementation-backed facts from operating commitments and items that still require
          provider, legal, or human confirmation.

        <h2>Your ACORN timetable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Gapwise does not ask for your ACORN password.</li>
          <li>The original ACORN .ics file is read and parsed in your browser.</li>
          <li>The application does not upload the original file or its source filename.</li>
          <li>Guest timetable, gap, and route planning can work without a Gapwise account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you choose to remember a timetable locally, parsed schedule data can remain in browser
          storage. If you enable private cloud sync, supported private state can also enter the
          encrypted sync flow described below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Accounts and private cloud</h2>
        <p>
          Sign-in is optional and currently uses Supabase Auth with Google, Microsoft, or GitHub as
          user-selected identity providers. Supported private cloud state is encrypted in the
          browser before Supabase storage. Vercel remains inside the cryptographic trust boundary
          because the server-side key broker unwraps and re-wraps data keys with a server-held key.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that reason, Gapwise describes this design as <strong>browser-encrypted</strong> or
          <strong> browser-side encrypted</strong>. It does not call the design end-to-end encrypted
          or zero knowledge. Account settings include an account-and-cloud-data deletion flow;
          provider backups, logs, retention, and production configuration are separate evidence
          questions and are not inferred from source code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Public API, private account state, and AI are separate boundaries</h2>
        <p>
          The public developer API is for deterministic campus information. It does not expose
          private student timetables, accounts, friends, private sync state, credentials, or precise
          live location. Private AI access is a separate opt-in delegation path.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the current core delegation contract, users select readable categories and separate
          write permissions. Core excludes friend data, personal-item notes, precise live location,
          primary encryption keys, and identity-provider or OAuth tokens from delegated snapshots.
          Academic timetable meetings are not an AI write target; typed writes are bounded to
          supported personal planning actions and preferences.

        <h2>Third parties and data residency</h2>
        <p>
          Current source shows Vercel for application/API hosting and aggregate product telemetry,
          Supabase for authentication and optional account/cloud storage, optional Google,
          Microsoft, and GitHub identity providers, OpenFreeMap for browser map requests, and the
          optional Gapwise AI boundary when a user enables it. Source data attribution is not the
          same thing as a runtime processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exact provider regions, contractual roles, subprocessor chains, backup/log retention, and
          some production dashboard settings require current provider or human evidence. The
          maintained inventory records those unknowns instead of guessing them.

        <h2>Retention, deletion, and privacy governance</h2>
        <p>
          Gapwise exposes browser controls for remembered data and application controls for account
          and cloud-data deletion. Source-defined deletion behavior is documented separately from
          provider backup and log retention, which must be confirmed from the relevant service.
          Internal privacy-governance material includes retention/deletion, data-rights, feature
          change, third-party review, and privacy-incident workflows; draft legal language remains
          subject to human or legal approval where marked.

        <h2>Vulnerability and incident handling</h2>
        <p>
          Gapwise publishes a vulnerability disclosure policy and canonical security.txt. The
          incident-response runbook separates verified evidence, process commitments, and
          confirmation-required facts; it covers severity, containment, provider escalation, privacy
          triage, notification decisions, recovery, and public postmortem preparation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gapwise publishes a dedicated public service-status surface at status.gapwise.ca. It
          reports current operational state and provides incident-reporting paths, but it does not
          claim an uptime percentage, response-time SLA, RTO, RPO, or historical incident statistic
          without measured evidence.

        <h2>Accessibility evidence</h2>
        <p>
          WCAG 2.2 Level AA is a product and review target, not a blanket conformance claim.
          Maintained browser tests use axe-core on selected states and exercise representative
          keyboard, focus-restoration, semantic-state, theme, and reduced-motion behavior. No
          repeatable manual screen-reader pass or third-party accessibility certification is
          currently claimed.

        <h2>Policies, change history, and independent review</h2>
        <p>
          Gapwise does not claim SOC 2, ISO 27001, an independent penetration test, VPAT
          certification, or another audit/certification unless a future assessment actually occurs
          and its scope and result are verified. Transparency templates likewise prohibit turning
          missing measurements into zero.
