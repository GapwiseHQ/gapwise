# Campus data and documentation boundaries

Canonical public multi-university campus facts, geometry, provenance, and data-maintenance guidance live in [`GapwiseHQ/data`](https://github.com/GapwiseHQ/data). The dataset covers 12 universities (University of Toronto, Carleton University, Toronto Metropolitan University, Queen's University, Wilfrid Laurier University, York University, McMaster University, Western University, University of Guelph, University of Ottawa, Brock University, and the University of British Columbia) across 14 campus models.

Public human-readable data documentation lives at **https://docs.gapwise.ca/data/**. The currently published raw distributions live at **https://data.gapwise.ca/datasets/**.

This repository intentionally retains only:

- the validated runtime compatibility snapshots under `src/data/campuses` and `src/data/utm`;
- deterministic routing, gap-planning, map, API, and SDK behavior;
- consumer-side tests and integration contracts;
- the transitional data-maintenance adapters that are still coupled to core routing types.

Do not add new source-of-truth campus facts or public data documentation here. Change canonical campus facts in `GapwiseHQ/data`, run the consumer sync once, and change released public documentation in `docs`.

The runtime app does **not** fetch `data.gapwise.ca` or GitHub on student requests. The snapshot is pinned and tested at build time for reliability.

## Consumer sync

After a canonical data PR is merged, the consumer update is intentionally one command:

```bash
bun run campus-data:sync
```

This now mirrors both `src/data/utm` **and** `public/data/utm-campus-v1.json`. The corresponding check command verifies both surfaces:

```bash
bun run campus-data:check
```

Do not manually copy individual entrance, graph, audit, or public-snapshot files between repositories.
