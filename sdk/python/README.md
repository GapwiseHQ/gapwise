# `gapwise`

Official typed Python client for the unauthenticated Gapwise multi-university Public Campus API v1. It supports Python 3.11+ and defaults to `https://api.gapwise.ca/v1`.

The canonical Python package is published on PyPI as `gapwise`. GitHub Packages does not provide a PyPI-compatible Python registry, so tagged Python releases are additionally mirrored on GitHub Releases as the verified wheel and source distribution built from the matching `python-v*` tag.

```bash
python -m pip install gapwise==0.1.1
```

For direct artifact use, the matching GitHub Release contains:

```text
gapwise-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
gapwise-0.1.1.tar.gz
```

PyPI remains the preferred installation channel; the GitHub release assets provide a source-adjacent mirror rather than a second Python package index.

```python
from gapwise import Gapwise

with Gapwise() as gapwise:
    info = gapwise.info()
    universities = gapwise.universities.list()
    campuses = gapwise.campuses.list()

    # Query buildings and routes for Carleton University
    carleton_buildings = gapwise.buildings.list(university="carleton")
    carleton_route = gapwise.routes.calculate(from_building="TB", to_building="ML", university="carleton")

    # Query UTM (default)
    mn = gapwise.buildings.get("MN")
    buildings = gapwise.buildings.list(q="instructional", category="academic")
    places = gapwise.places.list(building="HM", kind="library")
    route = gapwise.routes.calculate(from_building="MN", to_building="IB")

    for place in places.items:
        # Unknown is not closed; keep the distinction in your UI.
        print(place["name"], place["availability"]["state"])
```

```python
from gapwise import AsyncGapwise

async with AsyncGapwise() as gapwise:
    places = await gapwise.places.list(open_now="unknown")
```

Lists return a typed immutable `Page` with `items`, `pagination`, `data_version`, and `request_id`. Configure `base_url`, `timeout`, `headers`, or inject an `httpx.Client`/`AsyncClient`. Injected clients are never closed by the SDK.

Structured API failures raise `GapwiseAPIError` with `status_code`, stable `code`, optional `details`, and `request_id`. Network failures and timeouts raise `GapwiseTransportError`; malformed successful responses raise `GapwiseResponseError`.

API v1, campus data versions, and this package version evolve independently. See [`../../docs/DEVELOPER_PLATFORM.md`](../../docs/DEVELOPER_PLATFORM.md) for filtering, uncertainty, privacy, versioning, rate-limit, and migration guidance.
